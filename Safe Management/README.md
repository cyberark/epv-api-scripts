# Safe Management
> **Note:**The content of the sample_safes.csv is for example only and does not represent real safes

## Main capabilities
- This tool supports reporting of Safes, adding new Safes and adding new members to Safes.
- Adding and updating members can be done via a .csv file. See sample files for examples. Supported .csv files can be comma delimited (default) or tab delimited.
- Supported version: PVWA v12.1 and above.
- Four modes for **managing the Safes**: [*Report*](#report-command), [*Add*](#add-command), [*Update*](#update-command), [*Delete*](#delete-command).
  - On Add operations if only a safename is provided the safe will not be created unless "CreateSafeWithNameOnly" is also passed.
- Three modes for **managing Safes Members**: [*Members*](#members-command), [*UpdateMembers*](#update-members-command), [*DeleteMembers*](#delete-members-command)

## Authentication
- The script supports CyberArk authentication by default.
- To allow LDAP authentication to the script, make sure the [*SmartLogonEnabled*](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/Onlinehelp/PAS/latest/en/Content/PASIMP/General-PVWA-Configurations.htm) parameter in the PVWA configuration is set to *YES* and then run the script with your LDAP credentials (no changes required to the script).

- LogonToken
	- Logon token for using Privileged Cloud Shared Services (ISPSS).
	- To generate token, see: https://github.com/cyberark/epv-api-scripts/tree/main/Identity%20Authentication


## CyberArk Privilege Cloud - Shared Services
If working with CyberArk Privilege Cloud - Shared Services, make sure that "memberLocation" is blank and that "Member" includes the full username and directory for the user and/or group.

Examples:
- "Administrators@lab.local" and not "Administrators"
- "John.Doe@lab.local" and not "John.Doe"


## Safe Management

### Report Command:
```powershell
Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL <string> -Report  [-AuthType <string>] [-OTP <string>] [-SafeName <string>] [-OutputPath <string>] [-concurrentSession] [-DisableSSLVerify] [-DisableLogoff] [-logonToken <Object>] [-CreateSafeWithNameOnly] [-PVWACredentials <pscredential>] [-IncludeSystemSafes] [-CPMList <string[]>] [-GetCPMUsers] [-IncludeCallStack] [-UseVerboseFile] [<CommonParameters>]
```

List all Safes (based on the current user's permissions):
```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Report
```

Filter a specific Safe to see its details:
```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Report -SafeName "MySafe"
```

List all Safes (based on the current user's permissions) and output to report:
```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Report -OutputPath .\SafeReport.csv
```

List all Safes (based on the current user's permissions) and stores in a variable:
```powershell
$report = .\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault"
```

List all Safes (based on the current user's permissions) and stores in a variable:
```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Report -OutputPath .\SafeReport.csv
```

### Add Command:
```powershell
Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL <string> -Add [-logonToken $token] [-SafeName <string>] [-Description <string>] [-ManagingCPM <string>] [-NumVersionRetention <int>] [-FilePath <string>] [-CreateSafeWithNameOnly] [<CommonParameters>]
```

>*Note:* Using the [*Add*](#add-command) command depends on the .csv file format you use.
>
>Providing a .csv file with Safe details only, will create the Safe. See example file [`safe-details-sample.csv`](safe-details-sample.csv).
>
>Providing a .csv file with Safe members only, will add members to that safe (only to existing safes). See example file: [`safe-members-sample.csv`](safe-members-sample.csv)
>
>Providing a .csv file with both Safe details and Safe Members, will create the Safe and add the relevant members. See example file: [`safe-details and members-sample.csv`](safe-details_and_members-sample.csv)


Create a new Safe called 'MySafe':
```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Add -SafeName "MySafe"

```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Add -FilePath "C:\Temp\safes-sample.csv"
```

Create a list of Safes, if the file contains at least one addtional value for the safe properties, and add members to it from a file:
```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Add -FilePath "C:\Temp\safes-details_and_members-sample.csv"
```

Create a list of Safes, include those with only SafeName provided, and add members to it from a file:
```powershell

```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -Update -SafeName "MySafe" -Description "This is My updated Safe description that I Created using REST API"
```

Update the Safe Managing CPM:

## Troubleshooting:
The following can be used on all commands\
Log files with both switches present are required for troubleshooting.

```powershell
.\Safe-Management.ps1 -PVWAURL "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault" -AddMembers -FilePath "C:\Temp\safe-members-sample.csv" -IncludeCallStack -UseVerboseFile
```
IncludeCallStack adds call stack information to log files\
UseVerboseFile creates a second log file containing only verbose logs\
