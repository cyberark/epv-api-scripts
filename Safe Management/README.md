> **Note:**The content of the sample_safes.csv is for example only and does not represent real safes

Main capabilities
-----------------
- The tool Uses REST API and can support v12.1 of PVWA and up
- The tool supports listing of Safes, Adding new safes and adding new members to safes
- The tool can take a simple CSV file with safe details or members to add or update them

In order to run the tool you need to run some simple commands in Powershell.

The Tool supports four modes for managing the safes: [*List*](#list-command), [*Add*](#add-command), [*Update*](#update-command), [*Delete*](#delete-command) 

The Tool supports three modes for managing safes Members: [*Members*](#members-command), [*UpdateMembers*](#update-members-command), [*DeleteMembers*](#delete-members-command)

## Authentication
The script by default supports CyberArk authentication.
In order to allow also LDAP authentication to the script, make sure the [*SmartLogonEnabled*](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/Onlinehelp/PAS/latest/en/Content/PASIMP/General-PVWA-Configurations.htm) parameter in the PVWA configuration is set to *YES* and then simply run the script with your LDAP credentials (no changes required to the script).
