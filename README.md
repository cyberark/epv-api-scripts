# EPV REST API scripts examples
## Overview
REST APIs can provide end-to-end automation for key Privileged Access Management tasks, saving time and simplifying workloads for CyberArk [Core PAS](https://www.cyberark.com/products/privileged-account-security-solution/core-privileged-account-security/) users. 
This repository of downloadable REST API example scripts show users how to automate key processes across their Core PAS implementation, including securing privileged accounts, accessing data in CyberArk safes, responding to security events detected by Privileged Threat Analytics, and managing user accounts.
REST APIs are part of the default PVWA installation for most CyberArk customers and can be implemented immediately. 
>**Please note** These scripts were made available as examples to show customers how to use CyberArk REST APIs. They are not as a supported product of CyberArk.
## The Main Goal
Enable CyberArk users to automate and simplify privileged account management tasks via REST APIs such as account workflow, onboarding rules, permissions granting, and more. 
## REST API Technical Requirements
#### SDK Supported Platforms
The PAS SDK is a RESTful API that can be invoked by any RESTful client for various programming and scripting environments, including Java, C#, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.
#### The PAS SDK 
The PAS SDK enables you to perform activities on PAS objects via a REST Web Service interface. 
Each PAS object has its own URL path in the PVWA website that can be accessed using the relevant HTTPS request verb. 
Learn more about the technical specifications in our official [REST API technical documentation](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/Implementing%20Privileged%20Account%20Security%20Web%20Services%20.htm).
