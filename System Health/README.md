## Parameters:
```powershell
.\System-Health.ps1 -PVWAURL <string> [[-AuthType <string>] [-OTP <string>] [-PVWACredentials <PSCredential>] [-AllComponentTypes] [-ComponentType <string>] [-ComponentUser <string>] [-ComponentUserFilter <string>] [-AllServers] [-ConnectedOnly] [-DisconnectedOnly] [-MapFile <string>] [-DisableSSLVerify] [-Job] [-OutputObject] [-CyberArkCommon]]
```
- PVWAURL
	- The URL of the PVWA that you are working with. 
	- Note that the URL needs to include 'PasswordVault', for example: "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault"
	- If PVWAs credentials will be reset, do NOT use a load balancer address. Connect directly to a PVWA website to prevent script failure due to stopping the PVWA using by the script.

- AuthType

    - Used to pass credentials to be used with the PVWA via variable
        - Set credentials using ```$cred =  Get-Credential ```

- AllComponentTypes

            - IP address, Component Type, and OS can be set via the file.
            - If the IP Address in the mapping file is set to 255.255.255.255 those components users will be bypassed. 
    - This file must be used with Privileged Cloud environments
    - If IP Address 

- DisableSSLVerify
	**(NOT RECOMMENDED)**
