> **Note:** The content of the map.csv is for example only and does not represent real components

## Main capabilities
-----------------
* The tool Uses REST API
* Ensure that both Remote-CredFile.ps1 and CyberArk-Common.psm1 are in the same location
* The tool connects to Windows Server using WinRM
    * If WinRM needs to be enabled you can use following resources for assistance in enabling WinRM
        * https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1
        * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/how-to-enable-windows-remote-shell
* The tool currently does not work on components installed on Linux servers
    * This will be implemented in a future release
* The tool allows for override of IP Address, Component Types, and Operating System
* The tool requires administrative access to the server
    * By default connections are made using the credentials of the user running the script

## Parameters:
```powershell
.\Remote-CredFile.ps1 -PVWAURL <string> [[-DisableSSLVerify] [-AuthType] [-OTP] [-PVWACredentials] [-Jobs] [-AllComponents] [-AllServers] [-DisconnectedOnly] [-MapFile] [-PSCredentials] [-VaultAddress]
```
- PVWAURL
	- The URL of the PVWA that you are working with. 
	- Note that the URL needs to include 'PasswordVault', for example: "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault"
	- If PVWAs credentials will be reset, do NOT use a load balancer address. Connect directly to a PVWA website to prevent script failure due to stopping the PVWA using by the script.

    - This file must be used with Privileged Cloud environments
    - If IP Address 
- PSCredentials
    - Allows for use of alternate credentials to make connections to WinRM
