# Remote-CredFile

> **Note:** The content of the 'map.csv' file is for example only and does not represent real components.

## Main capabilities
- This script will attempt to regenerate the remote Applicative Cred File and Sync it in the Vault.
- This tool uses REST API.
- Ensure that both 'Remote-CredFile.ps1' and 'CyberArk-Common.psm1' are in the same location.
- This tool connects to Windows Server using WinRM. If WinRM needs to be enabled, you can use following resources for assistance:
    - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/how-to-enable-windows-remote-shell
- The tool currently does not work on components installed on Linux servers.
    - This will be implemented in a future release
- The tool allows override of IP Address, Component Types, and Operating System.
- The tool requires administrative access to the server.
    - By default connections are made using the credentials of the user running the script.

## Parameters:
```powershell
.\Remote-CredFile.ps1 -PVWAURL <string> [[-AuthType <string>] [-OTP <string>] [-PVWACredentials <PSCredential>] [-PSCredentials <PSCredential>] [-LogonToken <object>] [-AllComponentTypes] [-ComponentType <string>] [-ComponentUser <string>] [-ComponentUserFilter <string>] [-AllServers] [-ConnectedOnly] [-DisconnectedOnly] [-MapFile <string>] [-VaultAddress <string>] [-APIAddress <string>] [-DisableSSLVerify] [-Jobs]]
```
- PVWAURL
	- The URL of the PVWA. 
	- Note that the URL needs to include 'PasswordVault', for example: "https://myPVWA.myDomain.com/PasswordVault"
	- If PVWAs credentials are supposed to be reset during the process, do NOT use a load balancer address. Connect directly to the PVWA to prevent script failure due to stopping the PVWA by using the script.
- AuthType

	- Available values: _CyberArk, LDAP, RADIUS_
	- Default value: _CyberArk_
- OTP
    - One-time-password, in case you use RADIUS authentication

- ComponentUser
    - Select specified component Users.
    - Enclose the users in quotes and separe them by comma ","

        - IP address, Component Type, and OS can be set via the file.
        - Components users will be bypassed if the IP Address in the mapping file is set to 255.255.255.255. 
    - This file must be used with Privileged Cloud environments.
- VaultAddress
    - Resets the vault address within the 'vault.ini' file.
    - Whatever is provided will be set in the file. The new address(es) must be surrounded by double quotes.
